DRIVERS
- I have used extra features for checking if user is the same as the record to be read
- Sarah checks if the user already exists before creating one

- Tara only uses one method to check availability

- Sarah created her own exception

- Sarah uses a serialized way to create the users from the yaml file
- Check credentials & SecurityConfig from DrHouse accountancy solution from security reflection

RIDES
- Instructions are ambiguous leading to several interpretations of task at hand

- I need to separate into different endpoints depending on what I receive
